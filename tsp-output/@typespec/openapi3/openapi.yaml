        This endpoint is slightly slower as it will return an object for each individual departure time (or day). You have to perform this step to retrieve an `availabilityId` in order to confirm a sale, so if you just want to use this endpoint and skip the calendar endpoint then that's perfectly ok.

        You must pass in one of the following combinations of parameters for this endpoint:
        - `localDate`
        - `localeDateStart` and `localDateEnd`
        - `availabilityIds`
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/RequestHeaders.octoCapabilities'
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/RequestHeadersContent'
      responses:
        '200':
          description: The request has succeeded.

      description: |
        Reserving availability when making a booking. The steps to make a reservation are:

        1. **Check Availability**: Check the availability on the [/availability](docs/octo/branches/main/5b08f5f75e75d-availability-check) endpoint to retrieve an `availabilityId`
        2. **Booking Reservation** (this step): Create a booking that reserves the availability while you collect payment and contact information from the customer. The booking will remain with status `ON_HOLD` until the booking is confirmed or the reservation hold expires.

        The availability for the booking is held for the amount of time equal to the`expirationMinutes` parameter (if provided), up to an internal limit set by either the supplier or the OCTo provider. The `utc_expires_at` parameter in the response object will indicate when a reservtion will expire. A reservation can be extended by calling the [/bookings/{uuid}/extend](docs/octo/branches/main/2c7924ab9128f-extend-reservation) endpoint.

        A reserved booking can be confirmed after the customer finalizes their choice on the [/bookings/{uuid}/confirm](docs/octo/branches/main/614d1613b2d70-booking-confirmation) endpoint provided the reservation had not expired.

This code must conform to the BCP 47 standard, following RFC 5646 and RFC 4647 specifications for language tags. Examples include en-US for American English, fr-FR for French (France), and es-ES for Spanish (Spain).  Although not a standard HTTP header, it is commonly used in APIs to list available languages, such as en-US, fr-CA, es-ES, indicating that content can be requested in U.S. English, Canadian French, or Spanish. This response header is required when using Content capability.

          type: integer
          description: Represents the advertised marketing price, which must be equal to or higher than pricingFrom.retail. Typically used for strike-through pricing, it highlights the original or component-based value of the product when the retail price reflects a discount or bundled offer. For example, a package product combining multiple components (e.g., hotel + tour + meals) may have a total component value of $500 (original), while the bundled retail price is $400. In such cases, the original price is displayed to show savings.This field should only be shown when it is higher than pricingFrom.retail and must accurately reflect a valid reference price, ensuring transparency and trust.

            $ref: '#/components/schemas/Tax'
          description: This field defines the number of decimal places used for the currency in the pricingFrom object, ensuring precise representation and preventing rounding errors during calculations. For example, in currencies like USD, which have a precision of 2, prices are expressed in cents (e.g., $45.00 is represented as 4500). In currencies like JPY, which have a precision of 0, prices are expressed as whole yen amounts (e.g., ¥4500 is represented as 4500). By aligning with the specific decimal requirements of different currencies, this field guarantees accurate pricing calculations and consistent handling across various currency formats.
